Qualcomm MSM Piezo-electric Sound Buzzer

msm-piezo is a driver which utilizes the embedded M:N/D counter inside
Qualcomm chip.
It is used to provide a good range of clock source to piezzobuzzer.
In MSM8626, GPIO 22 is used for this functionality. GPIO 22 will need to
be selected as function 5. Check out MSM SW Interface document to see
which GPIO pin is used as GP_MN for your target to utilize this driver.
The frequency range that this driver provides is from 1KHz to 6KHz.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,msm-piezo"
- reg:				Physical base address of clock and MND counter registers
                    This address will be io-mapped during initialization
                    to allow direct read and write access
- reg-names:        Names of the base for the above register
					Register name referred in SW Interface document

Optional properties:
- qcom,piezo-frequency:		default target frequency to source piezo
- qcom,piezo-duration:		default duration of how long the clock will be
							turned on
- qcom,piezo-duty-cycle: 	default duty cycle
- qcom,piezo-command: 		default command state is 0(off)
- qcom,piezo-gp-mn-gpio: 	gpio pin used to source clock/frequency

Example:

msm-piezo {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-piezo";
	reg = <0xF9BFE040 0x04>;
		reg-names = "periph_ss_pdm";
	qcom,piezo-frequency = <4000>;
	qcom,piezo-duration = <5000>;
	qcom,piezo-duty-cycle = <50>;
	qcom,piezo-command = <0>;
	qcom,piezo-gp-mn-gpio = <22>;
	};
