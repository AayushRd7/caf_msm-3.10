TI (PANEL) Power Management
This device is designed to support positive / negative voltage for driving TFT-LCD panels.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "ti,tps65132".
- reg: i2c address to be used.
- pinctrl-names : This should be defined if a target uses gpio and pinctrl framework.
  See "pinctrl" in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/msm-pinctrl.txt.
  It should specify the names of the configs that pinctrl can install in driver
	Following are the pinctrl config that can be installed
	"pmx_tps_active" : Active configuration of pins, this should specify active
	config of enn & enp gpio (if used) defined in their pin groups.
	"pmx_tps_sleep" : Disabled configuration of pins, this should specify sleep
	config of enn & enp gpio (if used) defined in their pin groups.
- pinctrl-0 : This exoplains the active state of the enn & enp gpio lines.
- pinctrl-1 : This exoplains the suspend state of the enn & enp gpio lines.
- tps,enn-gpio: Enable pin for negative supply rail.
- tps,enp-gpio: Enable pin for positive supply rail.

Example:
	tps@3e {
		compatible = "ti,tps65132";
		reg = <0x3e>;
		pinctrl-names = "pmx_tps_active","pmx_tps_suspend";
		pinctrl-0 = <&tps_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&tps_suspend>;
		ti,enn-gpio = <&msm_gpio 32 0x00>;
		ti,enp-gpio = <&msm_gpio 97 0x00>;
	};
