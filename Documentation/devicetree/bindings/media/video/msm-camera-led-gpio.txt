* Qualcomm MSM CAMERA LED GPIO

LED triggered by a single GPIO.

Required properties:
- cell-index : Should contain source index to diffentiate
    between different LED devices. These indexes represent LED devices
    for multiple LEDs.
    - 0, 1, 2, 3
- compatible :
    - "qcom,led-gpio-flash"
    - "qcom,led-gpio-ir"
- gpios : should contain phandle to gpio controller node and one
    #gpio-cells specifying specific gpio (controller specific)
- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num : should contain index to gpio specific to this LED
- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-flags : should contain direction of gpio present in
    qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num property
- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-label : should contain name of gpio present in
    qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num property

Example:
	qcom,led-ir {
		cell-index = <0>;
		compatible = "qcom,led-gpio-ir";
		label = "led-ir-label";
		gpios = <&msm_gpio 31 0>;
		qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num = <0>;
		qcom,gpio-req-tbl-flags = <0>;
		qcom,gpio-req-tbl-label = "LED_IR_EN";
	};
