QTI Radio Frequency IC (RFIC)

This is a kernel platform driver which enables the RF interfaces supported by
QTI. This driver uses SSBI driver to access the low level registers. This has
support for Pulse Density Modulation(PDM) and General purpose RF Control(GRFC)s.
It is also possible to access GRFC without going through SSBI. There are 2
sections listed below, one using ssbi parent driver and the other direct access.

1. Driver access to get/set GRFC registers using ssbi driver.

Required properties:
-compatible: parent should be "qcom,ssbi"
-reg: physical base address and length of the register set
-reg-names: RFIC device is a child node of ssbi and uses the base address of
the parent driver. RFIC uses a large set of registers, hence base address is
defined here.
-qcom,controller-type: controller type could be "geni-ssbi-arbiter" or
"geni-ssbi2-arbiter"
-compatible: child should be "qcom,rfic-fsm9900" or "qcom,rfic-fsm9010"

Example for rfic driver using SSBI as a parent:
	ssbi1:  qcom,ssbi@f9b18000 {
		compatible = "qcom,ssbi";
		reg = <0xf9b18000 0x4000>;
		reg-names = "ssbi1_base";
		qcom,controller-type = "geni-ssbi-arbiter";

		rfic@1 {
			compatible = "qcom,rfic-fsm9900", "qcom,rfic-fsm9010";
		};
	};

2. Driver access to set/get GRFC registers without going thru SSBI. The following
driver entry is independent and does not use ssbi driver.

Required properties:
-compatible: should be "qcom,rfic-fsm9900" or "qcom,rfic-fsm9010"
-reg: specifies the base address of the GRFC registers.

- pinctrl-states: names of pinctrl states that are used by the driver to
	configure TLMM pins. States required by fsm9900 are "default",
	"mdm_m", "mdm_k" and "mdm_g". The "default" state selects the pin
	configuration required for probing the RF board while the remaining
	states select appropriate grfc pins specific to the detected RF board.
	Rfic driver for fsm9010 uses only a single state "default" that sets
	all the required grfc pins.

- pinctrl-#: a list of pinctrl phandles for the different pinctrl states. Refer
	to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt" for the
	pinctrl handles definitions. Each pinctrl-# corresponds to the respective
	state name that appears under pinctrl-state list.

Optional properties:
vdd-switch-supply: regulator used to control RF switches.
vdd-wtr-supply: regulator used to control WTR.
vdd-ftr1-supply: regulator used to control FTR1.
vdd-ftr2-supply: regulator used to control FTR2.
vdd-1v8-supply: regulator used to control 1.8V to all RFICs.
vdd-1v3-supply: regulator used to control 1.3V to all RFICs

- clocks: clock identifers used by clock driver while looking up pdm clocks.
- clock-names: name of the clock used by rfic driver.

rfic driver uses 3 resources as mentioned below in reg entry and resources
are exttracted using array number by platform_get_resource().

Example 1:
	qcom,rfic@fd4a4090 {
		compatible = "qcom,rfic-fsm9900";
		reg = <0xfd4a4090 0x40>,
			<0x3a000000 0xa00000>,
			<0xf9b10000 0x8000>;

		reg = <0xfd4a4090 0x40>;

		vdd-wtr-supply = <&pma8084_l19>;

		vdd-ftr2-supply = <&pma8084_l25>;
		vdd-1v8-supply = <&pma8084_l26>;
		vdd-1v3-supply = <&pma8084_l11>;
		pinctrl-names = "default", "mdm_m", "mdm_k", "mdm_g";
		pinctrl-0 = <&rf_detect_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&mdm_m_grfc_f1_active>;
		pinctrl-2 = <&mdm_k_grfc_f2_active &mdm_k_grfc_f3_active>;
		pinctrl-3 = <&mdm_g_grfc_f2_active>;
	};

	qcom,pdm@f9b10000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rfic-fsm9900";
		reg = <0xf9b10000 0x8000>;
	};

Example 2:
	qcom,rfic@fd4a4090 {

		reg = <0xfd4a4090 0x40>,
			<0x29000000 0xa00000>,

			<&clock_gcc clk_gcc_pdm2_ahb_clk>;
		clock-names = "pdm2_clk", "ahb_clk";
