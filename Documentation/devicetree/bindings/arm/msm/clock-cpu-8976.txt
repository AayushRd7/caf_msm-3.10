Qualcomm MSM8976 CPU clock tree

clock-cpu-8976 is a device that represents the MSM8976 CPU subystem clock
tree. It lists the various power supplies that need to be scaled when the
clocks are scaled and also other HW specific parameters like fmax tables etc.


Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be one of "qcom,clock-cpu-8976"

- reg:			Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
			memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:		Names of the bases for the above registers. Expected
			bases are:
			"c0-pll", "c1-pll", "c0-mux", "c1-mux", "cci-mux",
			"efuse", "perf_base"(optional).
- clocks:		The clocks sources used by the cluster/cci mux.
- clock-names:		Name of the clocks for the above clocks.
- vdd_mx-supply:	The regulator powering all the PLLs of cluster-0,
			cluster-1, cci.
- vdd_a72-supply:	The regulator powering the big cluster
- vdd_a53-supply:	The regulator powering the little cluster
- vdd_cci-supply:	The regulator powering the CCI cluster
- qcom,speedX-bin-vY-ZZZ:
			A table of CPU frequency (Hz) to voltage (corner)
			mapping that represents the max frequency possible
			for each supported voltage level for a CPU. 'X' is
			the speed bin into which the device falls into - a
			bin will have unique frequency-voltage relationships.
			'Y' is the characterization version, implying that
			characterization (deciding what speed bin a device
			falls into) methods and/or encoding may change. The
			values 'X' and 'Y' are read from efuse registers, and
			the right table is picked from multiple possible tables.
			'ZZZ' can be c1, c0 or cci depending on whether the table
			is for the big cluster, little cluster or cci.
Optional Properties:
- qcom,pboost-ratioX-vY: List of L values for combination of cores for a
			 particular speed-bin.
